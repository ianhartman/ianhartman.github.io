  First post in a quick series about my homebrew python-based vfx project pipeline.

## My Inspiration

Over the past few months I've been researching how to build / structure a pipeline for a team VFX project. My interest in the subject comes from a desire to fix problems and annoyances that have existed in the computer labs for a while. These range from extending existing Maya / NUKE functionality using simple scripts or gizmos to simplifying complicated processes to fewer prompts to the artist.

There is something to be said about having an invisible pipeline. If the artist can do their job without having to think about using the correct naming convention or other if their exports to hand off to the next artist are correct / sufficient, then the pipeline is working.

My current pipeline development is being hosted on [my Github](https://github.com/Hartman-/Basket). I first named the project Basket because I believe the Pipeline to be like a Fruit Basket, where the fruits are the tools that you put in the pipeline to make it better and more fruitful.

In the next couple posts I'll breakdown the basics of my repository so far and what I plan to accomplish.
