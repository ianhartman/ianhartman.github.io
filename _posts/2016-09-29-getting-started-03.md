  Third, and final, post in a quick series about my homebrew python-based vfx project pipeline.

## Moving Forward

In the next itearations I want to extend the functionality of the Basket Pipeline Toolset to hook into Houdini 15.5 to setup the project, sim cache, directories, and any other output directories like with Maya and Nuke. 

As well as refactoring the code repository that I have now to slim down the code base and make it easier to read for myself and others. 

Finally, I need to enable the user to setup thier project definitions in Nuke and Maya, probably going to handle this in the launch phase of my scripts.
